## Abstract:

[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

New York Times Top Stories, is an application that allows a user to explore the New York Times daily Top Stories all in one application! Using the NYTs Top Stories API, On Load you'll be taken to the home page and the news will be set to the "Home" category, and you'll see all of the top stories from NYT's Home page. From there a user is able to scroll through the articles.  A user is able to change the category and the news articles will switch to the relevant category. Additionally, form any category a user is able to filter through the titles of the news for keywords. 

The app incorporates a responsive layout and will change its structure to fit both large and mobile displays. It was built using functional React Hooks, Controlled form pattern, React Router.  

i built this in 7 hours as part of Turing School of Software and Design's 4th quarter's take home mock interview.

 In the near future, I plan to add  End-To-End Testing using Cypress where fetch requests are stubbed with fixtures and sad paths are tested to ensure intended execution. I plan to add more industry styled CSS. Finally I would like to add more NYT api's to this app like the the Most Popular Api and the Book Api!
  
I hope you have fun using NYT - Top Stories!!
